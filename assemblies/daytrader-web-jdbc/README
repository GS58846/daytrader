This is a version of daytrader which is able to running on Tomcat 6. 
By default, it uses a Derby database. You can change  -
    src/main/webapp/META-INF/context.xml
to use another database vendor. Remember to copy the database jdbc drivers 
to the Tomcat lib directory.

After building, just deploy the .war in the target directory to Tomcat with
context root /daytrader.

Of course, it works as well on the Geronimo Minimal Jetty or Tomcat assemblies.
Before deploying it, you will need to deploy the datasource in -
    daytrader-derby-datasource-plan.xml
