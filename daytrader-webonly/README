This is a version of daytrader which is able to running on Tomcat 6. 
By default, it uses Derby database. You can change src/main/webapp/META-INF/context.xml
to use other database vendor. Remember that copying database jdbc drivers to tomcat lib
directory.

After building, just deploy the .war in the target directory to tomcat with context root /daytrader.

Of course, it works as well as on Little-G with Tomcat 6. Before deploying it 
to Little-G, you need to deploy a datasource first. Refer to daytrader-datasource-plan.xml
for an example.
